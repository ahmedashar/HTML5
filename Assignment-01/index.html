        Story About How The URL Was Built:
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Internet is one of the greatest inventions of mankind, but it would have amounted to little if not for the
        World Wide Web (WWW). So much so that we use the two words “Internet” and “Web” synonymously. Technically, the
        Internet is the infrastructure connecting billions of computers together, and the Web is a service built on top
        of this. The Web is what we use every day to do everything from looking up information to connecting with people
        across the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Web was invented as a solution to the problem of passing around information between computers. Although this
        was possible before the Web, the absence of a uniform format and protocol made the whole process cumbersome.
        “Often it was just easier to go and ask people when they were having coffee,”writes Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who
        invented the WWW in 1989. “I actually wrote some programs to take information from one system and convert it so
        it could be inserted into another system. More than once. And when you are a programmer, and you solve one
        problem and then you solve one that’s very similar, you often think, ‘Isn’t there a better way? Can’t we just
        fix this problem for good?’ That became, ‘Can’t we convert every information system so that it looks like part
        of some imaginary information system which everyone can read?’ And that became the WWW.”

    <p>
        The WWW stands on three pillars: HTML, the language we use to make web pages; HTTP, the protocol we use to send
        and receive resources over the Internet; and the URL. Here, we’ll explore the history and role of each of the
        components that make up the URL, which Berners-Lee describes as the “most fundamental specification of Web
        architecture.”

    <h3>What is the URL?</h3>
    <p>
        Once we expand the abbreviation, URL becomes self-explanatory. The uniform resource locator is simply an address
        to a resource on the Internet, most often a web page.
    <p>
        When we wish to access a resource on the Web, the web browser on our computer has to connect to the web server
        hosting the desired resource and locate the resource within this server. The details for which web server to
        connect to, where to look within the server, and what to look for are specified in the URL.
    </p>
    <p>
        We mostly use URLs by either directly typing them into the browser’s address bar or by clicking on hyperlinks.
    </p>
    <p>
        A URL is made of multiple components, each with its own history and purpose. Here’s a breakdown of these
        components:
